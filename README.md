## Admin survey & reports API docs

This is short API documentation for fetching reports data. Before taking the API in to use, make sure to contact our technical team (support@heiaheia.com).

Built with Slate.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You're going to need:

- **Linux or macOS** — Windows may work, but is unsupported.
- **Ruby, version 2.3.1 or newer**
- **Bundler** — If Ruby is already installed, but the `bundle` command doesn't work, just run `gem install bundler` in a terminal.

### Getting Set Up

```shell
# either run this to run locally
bundle install
bundle exec middleman server
```

You can now see the docs at http://localhost:4567.
